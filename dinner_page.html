            Ingredients:<br>
            -5L water<br>
            -200g sausage mince (pork, veal and fennel)<br>
            -200g mixed mushrooms (porcini & wild)<br>
            -Extra virgin olive oil (XVOO)<br>
            -500g fresh tagliatelle pasta<br>
            -1 x glass white wine<br>
            -Salt<br>
            -Fresh parsley<br>
            -Parmesan cheese <br>
            <br>
            
            To make the mushroom pasta, first boil the water on the stove in a large pot.
            Pour 5-6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil into a pan and warm up on a medium heat.
            Add 200g of sausuage mince and break into smaller pieces using a fork or wooden spoon,
            spreading it out to cook well on your pan.
            Leave to simmer for around 10 minutes or until cooked through.
            Add the key ingredients – porcini and wild mushrooms – and cook for another 7-8 minutes.
            Once this has cooked well and you have the DIVINE smell sifting through your kitchen, 
            add a glass of white wine and leave to evaporate for at least another 5 minutes. 
            Add a sprinkle of salt to the mushroom pasta and mix through well using a fork or tongs.
            Turn the mixture down to a low heat while you cook your pasta.
            By now, the water should be boiling in your large pot.
            Add the fresh pasta and leave to cook according to the packet instructions.
            Once cooked, strain the pasta and add it to the fry pan. Sprinkle some freshly grated parmesan cheese on top (be generous), and mix through. Repeat if you love a little extra cheese…!
